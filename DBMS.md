| Q# | Question                                                                                                                                  | Answer                                                                                                                                                  | Concept(s) Tested                  | Difficulty |
| -- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1  | Youâ€™re designing a system where users can add products to a wishlist. How would you organize your tables to avoid duplicate product info? | Use normalization, separate product info into a `Product` table, and reference it in a `Wishlist` table with user-product mapping to avoid duplication. | Normalization, Schema Design       | Medium     |
| 2  | Imagine your appâ€™s queries are slow because it scans the entire table every time. What could you add to improve performance?              | Add indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses to speed up lookups.                                                         | Indexing                           | Medium     |
| 3  | You notice your database has redundant data causing inconsistency. How would you approach fixing this?                                    | Apply normalization rules (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity.                                                          | Normalization, Data Integrity      | Medium     |
| 4  | How would you handle a scenario where a student can enroll in many courses and a course has many students?                                | Use a many-to-many relationship implemented via a join table, e.g., `StudentCourse(student_id, course_id)`.                                             | Many-to-many relationships         | Medium     |
| 5  | You want to ensure that no two users have the same email but still allow some fields to be optional. How would you design constraints?    | Use a UNIQUE constraint on the `email` column while allowing NULLs for optional fields.                                                                 | Keys, Constraints                  | Medium     |
| 6  | While inserting data, you get an error related to a foreign key. What might be causing this?                                              | The foreign key value doesn't exist in the referenced table, violating referential integrity constraints.                                               | Referential Integrity, Constraints | Easy       |
| 7  | You have a report that aggregates sales data but it runs very slowly on large data. What trade-offs could you consider to speed it up?    | Use denormalization to reduce JOINs, or create summary tables/materialized views for faster aggregation at the cost of data redundancy.                 | Denormalization, Performance       | Medium     |
| 8  | Your app crashes when two users try to update the same record at once. How do transactions help here?                                     | Transactions ensure atomicity and isolation (ACID), so concurrent updates do not cause inconsistent states via locks or rollbacks.                      | ACID properties, Transactions      | Medium     |
| 9  | When should you use a view instead of querying the base tables directly?                                                                  | Use views to simplify complex queries, provide abstraction, or restrict access to sensitive data by exposing limited columns.                           | Views, Query abstraction           | Medium     |
| 10 | How do you protect your database from malicious input that tries to manipulate queries?                                                   | Use parameterized queries/prepared statements to avoid SQL Injection attacks by separating code and data.                                               | SQL Injection, Security Practices  | Medium     |
| 12 | A developer suggests deleting old logs with `DELETE` but you want to avoid long locks. What else can you do?                              | Use `TRUNCATE` for fast bulk deletion (if you want to remove all rows), or partition tables to drop partitions easily without locks.                    | DELETE vs TRUNCATE, Locking        | Medium     |
| 13 | Explain what happens when you create a composite primary key and why you might use one.                                                   | A composite key uses multiple columns to uniquely identify a row, useful when no single column is unique alone (e.g., in join tables).                  | Composite Keys, Primary Key        | Medium     |
| 14 | How do you decide between using an index and adding more server resources when performance degrades?                                      | First optimize queries with indexes; adding hardware helps but may be costly. Indexes give better performance gains for read-heavy loads.               | Indexing, Performance Tuning       | Hard       |
| 15 | In your database, some queries need fast inserts and others need fast reads. How can you balance this?                                    | Balance normalization and denormalization. Normalize for inserts and data integrity; denormalize for faster reads and aggregation.                      | Denormalization vs Normalization   | Hard       |
