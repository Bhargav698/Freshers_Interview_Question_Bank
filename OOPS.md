| -- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1  | You're building a ride-sharing app. How would you represent different vehicle types in code?          | Use Inheritance with a base `Vehicle` class and subclasses like `Bike`, `Car`, `Auto`. | Inheritance, Polymorphism             | Medium     |
| 2  | If I remove the constructor from a class that initializes values, what happens?                       | Object will use default constructor; custom values won't be set.                       | Constructors                          | Easy       |
| 3  | How do you restrict access to sensitive data inside a class?                                          | Use `private` access modifier and provide `getters/setters`.                           | Encapsulation                         | Easy       |
| 4  | You want a class that can't be extended. What do you do?                                              | Declare the class as `final`.                                                          | Inheritance control                   | Medium     |
| 5  | How do you ensure all your object types implement a certain method?                                   | Define an Interface and implement it.                                                  | Abstraction, Interface                | Medium     |
| 6  | You have multiple login user types (admin, guest, user). How would you handle this?                   | Use method overriding in subclasses of a base `User` class.                            | Polymorphism                          | Medium     |
| 7  | If two classes have the same method name, how is it resolved?                                         | At runtime if overridden (polymorphism), at compile-time if overloaded.                | Method Overloading & Overriding       | Medium     |
| 8  | How do you prevent someone from creating multiple objects of a class?                                 | Use Singleton pattern.                                                                 | Singleton, Object control             | Medium     |
| 9  | Whatâ€™s better for defining a blueprint â€” Interface or Abstract Class?                                 | Interface when behavior is expected from multiple unrelated classes.                   | Abstraction                           | Medium     |
| 10 | Imagine a `Person` class where name should never be changed once set. How will you design it?         | Make the `name` field `private final` and initialize it via constructor only.          | Immutability                          | Medium     |
| 11 | You are given a class where anyone can directly change the data. What issue might this cause?         | Breaks encapsulation; data can become inconsistent or insecure.                        | Encapsulation                         | Easy       |
| 12 | What would happen if a class inherits two methods with the same signature from two interfaces?        | The class must override the method to resolve conflict.                                | Multiple Inheritance (via Interfaces) | Hard       |
| 13 | Why is abstraction helpful in large-scale applications?                                               | Hides implementation details and allows teams to work independently on modules.        | Abstraction                           | Medium     |
| 14 | How can OOP help in reducing code duplication across multiple classes?                                | Through inheritance and polymorphism.                                                  | Code Reusability                      | Medium     |
| 15 | How would you explain the difference between "is-a" and "has-a" relationships in real world examples? | "is-a" for inheritance (Car is-a Vehicle), "has-a" for aggregation (Car has-a Engine). | Inheritance vs Aggregation            | Easy       |

        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public int getAge() { return age; }
}

// Mutable class
public class MutablePerson {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public MutablePerson(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() { return name; }
