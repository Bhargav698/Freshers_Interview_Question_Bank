|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| 1  | You visit a website. Explain what happens from browser to server.                                | DNS resolves domain → TCP connection → HTTP request → server processes → sends HTTP response → browser renders.                                              | DNS, HTTP, TCP/IP             | Medium     |
| 2  | Why does Netflix use CDN?                                                                        | To deliver content closer to users, reducing latency and improving speed via **edge servers**.                                                               | CDN, Performance, Latency     | Easy       |
| 3  | Why is UDP preferred in online games over TCP?                                                   | **UDP** is faster, no overhead of reliability. Games can tolerate some loss but need **real-time data**.                                                     | UDP vs TCP                    | Medium     |
| 4  | Your site works on HTTP but fails on HTTPS. What could be wrong?                                 | Issues with **SSL certificate**, **port 443**, or **TLS handshake**.                                                                                          | HTTPS, TLS/SSL, Security      | Medium     |
| 5 | A user says their app is running slow. How will you troubleshoot?                                    | network congestion, server load.                                                                             |Latency, Troubleshooting | Medium     |
| 6 | If the internet is slow but local file sharing is fast, where’s the issue?                       | Problem lies in **WAN/ISP**, not in the local **LAN**.                                                                                                       | LAN vs WAN                    | Easy       |
| 7 | What's the role of a router in a home network?                                                   | It connects **multiple devices** and forwards packets between **LAN and Internet**.                                                                          | Router          | Easy       |
| 8 | What is the difference between HTTP and WebSocket?                                               | HTTP is **request-response**, WebSocket is **full-duplex** persistent connection for real-time apps.                                                         | Protocols, Real-time Comm     | Medium     |
| 9 | You’re designing a chat app. Why use WebSocket over HTTP?                                        | For **real-time bi-directional communication**, WebSockets are more efficient.                                                                               | WebSocket vs HTTP             | Medium     |
| 10 | Why do we need subnetting?                                                                       | To divide large networks into smaller ones for **efficiency, security, and routing**.                                                                        | Subnetting, IP Addressing     | Medium     |
| 11 | What is the role of 3-way handshake in TCP?                                                      | Ensures **connection establishment**, both sides agree to start communication with synchronized sequence numbers.                                            | TCP handshake, Connection     | Medium     |
